# monte-carlo-sims

Examples of Monte Carlo simulations.
Each example includes
* a code script (`.m`) and
* its published file (`.pdf`). These are in the `pdf` folder.

There is also a directory called `fn`. This folder contains functions used in the examples.
These functions were adapted from the initial version of professor **Yuhan Ding**, from the Illinois Institute of Technology (**IIT**).

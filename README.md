# monte-carlo-sims

Examples of Monte Carlo simulations.
Each example includes
* a code script (`.m`) and
* its published file (`.pdf`). These are in the `pdf` folder.

There are also MATLAB functions (also `.m`) defined among the examples.
These functions are used throughout the examples.

## Dependencies

The only MATLAB module that may be required to run the examples is the _Statistics Toolbox_.

The code uses the [GAIL](http://gailgithub.github.io/GAIL_Dev/) library.
Downoload version 2.3.2 to run the full scripts.

## Acknowledgement

Some code is adapted from the initial version of professor **Yuhan Ding**, from the Illinois Institute of Technology (**IIT**).

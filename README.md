# monte-carlo-sims

Examples of Monte Carlo simulations.
Each example includes
* a code script (`.m`) and
* its published file (`.pdf`). These are in the `pdf` folder.

There are also functions with MATLAB code (`.m`) among the examples.
These functions are used in the examples.
They were adapted from the initial version of professor **Yuhan Ding**, from the Illinois Institute of Technology (**IIT**).

The code uses functions implemented in the [GAIL library](http://gailgithub.github.io/GAIL_Dev/).
Downoload version 2.3.2 to run the full scripts.
